# Developing CI/CD Solutions with Azure DevOps
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Developing CI/CD Solutions with Azure DevOps. 

As a developer, you need to field a constant flow of requests for new features, updates, and bug fixes. By using Azure pipelines, you're able to build your applications and catch bugs early. In this course, Prince Mokut teaches you to configure a fully automated continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline in Azure. Prince starts with a high-level overview of Azure pipelines concepts, and then demonstrates how to enable continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployments to target environments in Azure Cloud. He illustrates the benefits of these processes and how to secure the pipelines for their teamâ€™s development projects. Prince shares various features that can make your pipeline configuration easier, and shows you how to define a pipeline to build and deploy a .NET solution to the Azure app service.
